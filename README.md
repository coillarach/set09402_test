SET09402 Software Engineering

This is a stub repository that contains some useful features such as a .gitignore file that prevents object code being committed.

You can use it for the practical exercises as well as for the coursework exercise. You should create a new repository exclusively for the coursework though, rather than re-using the same one. This will help keep things tidy.

The default project is entitled *Haulage* because that corresponds to the topic of the coursework. You may wish to change the project name when using the stub repo for other purposes.

To create a copy of the repo, click the green button labelled *Use this template* rather than the *Code* button.
